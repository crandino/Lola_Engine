Useful tips:

- Camera: Camera can be moved with A/D (left/right), W/S (up/down) and R/F (front/back). Holding right mouse button, the camera will orbit.
- Windows: The engine has different windows that may be activated: 
  - Num 1: Show Hierarchy
  - Num 2: Show Configuration
  - Selecting GameObject on Hierarchy: Inspector (Component information) appears from that selected gameobject.
- Loading files: You have to drag and drop any FBX format-like file on Assets/Models folder to instantly load them.
- Deleting gameobjects: Selecteing a GameObject and pressing _Supr_ will delete it, including all its children.
